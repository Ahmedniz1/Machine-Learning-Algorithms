# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repository serves as a collection of various machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch, primarily inspired by scikit-learn (sklearn) implementations. The aim is to understand the underlying principles and mechanics of these algorithms by implementing them ourselves.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, with a focus on clustering algorithms at the moment. The implementations are written in Python using NumPy and are structured to be easily understandable and modifiable. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch, drawing inspiration and insights from the corresponding algorithms in scikit-learn.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Clustering
- **KMeans:** 
- **DBSCAN:** 

## Usage

The implementations are provided as Python modules within the repository. You can import them into your projects and use them just like any other Python module. Additionally, each algorithm module contains usage examples and demonstrations to help you understand how to use them effectively.

## How to Run

To run the KMeans algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the MLA folder in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run the following command: 
```bash
python -m test.kmeans
